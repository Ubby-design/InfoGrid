# InfoGrid
InfoGrid as a headless operational intelligence platform that powers flexibility, stability and outcome-driven operations.

Basically could be considered as Documentation as a Service (DaaS):
A structured, real-time knowledge delivered through API, that's actionable and intelligence-ready.

Operational Intelligence Workflow:
       
1. Knowledge Ingestion
2. Structuring & Intelligence Layer
3. Continous Auto-Sync (ensures real-time data)
4. Intelligence Usage ( Action/Execution)
5. AI & Intelligence Layer (Predictive, Recommendations & Auto Remediations)
