1.2 Auto Sync (continuous)

Instead of:

“Upload files manually”

You use:

webhooks
git pull
cron sync
CI triggers

Example
git push → GitHub Action → sync → InfoGrid


So:

always fresh

always accurate

zero manual work

Huge value.



**Simple Expalnation:

Think of it like this:

Step 1 — You save your work
git push


You send your new files to GitHub.

Step 2 — Robot wakes up 🤖

GitHub Actions says:

“Oh! New code detected. Let me deploy it.”

Step 3 — Robot does tasks

It:

installs dependencies

builds site/app

tests

copies files to server

Step 4 — InfoGrid updates automatically

Your server refreshes.

Users see new version instantly.

No manual copying. No SSH. No stress.
