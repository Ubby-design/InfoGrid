2.3 Intelligence Layer (Business Logic / AI)

This is the brain:

Dependency Analysis: which pipelines / services affect others

Impact Assessment: “If I deploy service A, what downstream services are affected?”

Automation Suggestions: “Deploy pipeline X → triggers runbook Y”

AI Recommendations: “Rollback steps last time failed at step 3 → suggest alternate command”

This layer is what converts static knowledge into operational intelligence.
