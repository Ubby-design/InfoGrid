🟣 2.5 Internal Architecture (High-Level)
Logical layers:

Ingestion Layer (Step 1) → raw knowledge

Parsing / Structuring Layer → entities & relationships

Graph/Database Layer → stores entities & connections

Graph DB (Neo4j / ArangoDB) or relational DB + relationships table

Intelligence Layer → reasoning, triggers, AI suggestions

Execution Layer → pipelines, runbooks, API calls

Analytics Layer → metrics, usage, compliance reports

Think of Step 2 as layer 2–4 in this architecture.
