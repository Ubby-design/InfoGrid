🟤 2.6 Technical Considerations

Database choice:

Graph DB → best for dependencies & impact analysis

Relational → simpler, good for small-scale

API layer:

Expose structured knowledge for UI / automation / AI

Event-driven updates:

Use webhooks, message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)

Versioning:

Every entity has history → rollback & audit ready

NOTES:

🔥 Step 2 Outcome

After Step 2, InfoGrid:

Knows all services, pipelines, infra, runbooks

Understands how everything is connected

Can recommend actions / detect impact

Provides structured, queryable data for AI or automation

Prepares the system to execute tasks automatically in Step 3+

In short: Step 2 turns raw knowledge into a living operational brain.

✅ One-Line Summary

Step 2 = transform ingested operational data into structured, connected, queryable intelligence that powers automation, AI insights, and actionable decisions.
