1.3 Parsing (VERY important)

This is where magic begins.

InfoGrid doesn’t just copy files.

It understands them.

Example 1 — Markdown

Input:

deploy payments service:
helm upgrade payments ./chart


Parser extracts:

type: runbook
service: payments
action: deploy
command: helm upgrade


Now machine-readable.

Example 2 — GitHub Actions YAML

Input:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - helm upgrade payments


Parser extracts:

pipeline: deploy
service: payments
environment: prod
trigger: manual

Example 3 — Helm chart

Input:

service:
  name: payments
  port: 8080


Parser extracts:

service: payments
port: 8080
dependencies: db, redis

Example 4 — Terraform

Input:

resource "aws_db_instance" "payments_db"


Parser extracts:

resource: database
service: payments
provider: AWS
