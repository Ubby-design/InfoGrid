🔵 Step 5 Workflow (full picture)

Let’s connect everything:

Step 1: Ingest knowledge
Step 2: Structure
Step 3: Sync live
Step 4: Execute actions
Step 5: Think + Decide + Recommend + Auto-fix

Real-life flow
Scenario: Deployment

Engineer clicks deploy

Step 5 runs pre-checks

Detects risk

Suggests canary instead

Executes safer strategy

Monitors rollout

If errors → auto rollback

All automatic.

🟣 Technical Implementation (practical)

Keep it simple first.

You don’t need “crazy AI”.

Start with:

Phase 1 — Rules-based (easy)

YAML rules

thresholds

conditions

Example:

if failure_rate > 30%:
  recommend: rollback


Very powerful already.

Phase 2 — Analytics

metrics history

anomaly detection

trend analysis

Tools:

Prometheus

Grafana

logs

simple Python models

Phase 3 — AI/LLM

Later:

semantic search

natural language:
“Why is staging unstable?”

root cause summaries

auto runbook generation

This becomes premium tier.

🟠 What clients SEE (important)

They don’t see “AI”.

They see:

Dashboard

Payments Service

Status: ⚠ Unstable
Suggestion: Rollback recommended
Confidence: 82%
[Rollback Now]

Or:

Incident detected
Auto-remediation executed
MTTR: 35s
Saved downtime: $8,200

They think:

“This system saves us money automatically.”

That’s how you justify high pricing.

🔴 Why this beats competitors
Feature	Docs tools	InfoGrid V4
Store docs	✅	✅
Sync	❌	✅
Execute	❌	✅
Recommend	❌	✅
Predict failures	❌	✅
Auto-fix	❌	✅

You’re no longer in the docs market.

You’re competing with:

PagerDuty

Runbook automation tools

Incident platforms

DevOps internal tooling

These budgets are HUGE.

🟢 Monetization Impact

Now pricing becomes very realistic:

Because:

👉 You reduce downtime + risk

Example:

If client loses $10k/hour downtime
and InfoGrid saves 2 hours/month
= $20k saved

Charging $5k/month is easy.

🔥 Step 5 Outcome

After Step 5, InfoGrid becomes:

“Self-improving operations brain”

Not:
❌ docs
❌ wiki
❌ automation scripts

But:
✅ intelligent decision system

✅ One-line summary

Step 5 = make InfoGrid think, predict, recommend, and sometimes fix problems automatically.

You have now completed the full system:

✅ Step 1 — Ingest
✅ Step 2 — Structure
✅ Step 3 — Sync
✅ Step 4 — Execute
✅ Step 5 — Intelligence

This is the complete Operational Intelligence Platform architecture.
