Perfect — now we enter Step 5, the layer that makes InfoGrid feel “smart” instead of just automated.

Up to Step 4, InfoGrid is already very powerful:

✅ Knows everything (structured knowledge)
✅ Always up-to-date (sync)
✅ Can execute actions (automation)

But now we add:

🧠 Step 5 — AI & Intelligence Layer (Prediction + Recommendations + Auto-Remediation)

This is where InfoGrid becomes:

👉 Operational Intelligence, not just automation.

🔥 Big Idea First (simple)
Before Step 5

User must decide:

“What should I run?”

After Step 5

InfoGrid suggests or acts:

“This will likely fail. Rollback recommended. Click here.”

Even better:

“Failure detected → rollback executed automatically.”

🚨 Why Step 5 matters

Without AI:

reactive

manual

operator decides

With AI:

proactive

predictive

partially autonomous

This is what separates:

Level	Product Type
Docs	Knowledge storage
V3	Automation platform
V4 (Step 5)	Intelligence system

This is enterprise-grade territory.

🟢 Step 5 Core Capabilities

We add 3 intelligence types:

1️⃣ Recommendation Engine (Assist)

System suggests actions.

Example

User opens "payments service"

InfoGrid shows:

⚠ Last 3 deploys failed
⚠ CPU spikes after deploy
✅ Recommend: canary deploy

How it works

Data sources:

deploy history

logs

past incidents

failure rates

Rules or AI:

pattern detection

simple ML/statistics

Output:

suggestions

warnings

best practices
