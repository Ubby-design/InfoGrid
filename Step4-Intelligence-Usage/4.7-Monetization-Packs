4.7 Monetization becomes EASY here

Now pricing makes sense:

Starter

$500/mo

docs + sync

Pro

$2k/mo

actions + workflows

Enterprise

$5k–$10k/mo

automation + compliance + AI

Because:

👉 you are automating their operations


Step 4 Outcome

After Step 4, InfoGrid becomes:

NOT

Documentation

BUT

Operational Intelligence Platform

🔥 One-line summary

Step 4 = turn structured knowledge into safe, one-click operational actions that run automatically.

✅ What’s next

We now completed:

✅ Step 1 — Ingestion
✅ Step 2 — Structuring
✅ Step 3 — Sync
✅ Step 4 — Execution

The next layer is:

👉 Step 5 — AI & Intelligence (predictions, recommendations, auto-remediation)

This is the V4 “SaaS Intelligence Layer”.

This is where you can beat even enterprise tools.
