KNOWLEDGE INGESTION:

The foundation of the entire “Operational Intelligence” idea 

If Step 1 is weak → InfoGrid becomes “just another docs site.”
If Step 1 is strong → InfoGrid becomes intelligent + automatable + monetizable.

Step 1 — Knowledge Ingestion (Detailed)
What Step 1 really means

Most tools think:

“Users will write documentation manually.”

That’s the first mistake competitors make.

Engineers hate writing docs.

So their docs:

outdated

incomplete

stale

ignored

Human writes docs → upload → store → done

Problems:

manual

slow

outdated fast

unreliable

low trust

So clients won’t pay much.

✅ InfoGrid Approach
👉 “Don’t ask humans to write knowledge — extract it automatically.”

This is the key innovation.

🟢 Step 1 Goal
Convert ALL operational knowledge into structured, machine-readable data

Not just markdown.

Sources:

code repos

CI/CD

infra configs

scripts

runbooks

markdown

incidents

APIs

Because:

👉 Real operational knowledge lives in code, not docs.

🧩 Step-by-Step Mechanics

Let’s break Step 1 into sub-steps.

🔹 1.1 Connect sources

InfoGrid connects to:

Inputs

A. Git repositories:

GitHub / GitLab / Bitbucket

Contains:

markdown

Helm

Terraform

YAML

scripts

runbooks

B. CI/CD systems:

.github/workflows
.gitlab-ci.yml
jenkinsfiles


Contains:

deploy steps

build commands

environments

C. Infra configs

helm charts
terraform
k8s manifests
docker compose

Contains:

services

ports

dependencies

D. Optional

S3 buckets

incident logs

API specs (OpenAPI)

monitoring configs

🔥 Why this matters

Competitors only ingest:

markdown


InfoGrid ingests:

entire operational stack


This is the difference between:

❌ docs
vs
✅ intelligence











































Which makes the platform low value.
