1.6 Store in knowledge graph (advanced/optional later)

At V4 scale:

You can use:

graph DB


So relationships are explicit:

payments → uses → db
payments → deploys via → pipeline
pipeline → owned by → team


This enables:

AI reasoning

smart suggestions

dependency analysis

Very few competitors do this.



Objectives of step 1:


🔥 What Step 1 really produces

After ingestion, you don’t have:

files


You have:

structured operational knowledge


Which looks like:

{
  service: payments,
  actions: [deploy, rollback],
  pipeline: deploy-prod,
  owner: DevOps,
  environment: prod,
  commands: [...]
}


Now you can:

✅ automate
✅ recommend
✅ execute
✅ analyze

🧠 Why Step 1 is your secret moat

Because:

Without Step 1

You’re:

a wiki

With Step 1

You’re:

an intelligence engine

Competitors:

store text

InfoGrid:

understands systems

This difference justifies:
$49 vs $2,000+

🔥 Super simple analogy
Competitors

Google Drive for docs

InfoGrid

GitHub + Runbook automation + Knowledge graph + Search + CI/CD brain

✅ Final one-line summary
Step 1 =

👉 Automatically extract, parse, and structure operational knowledge from repos and infra into machine-readable intelligence instead of static files.

Everything else (automation, AI, billing power) depends on this.
