Goal:
Keep all operational knowledge fresh, accurate, and actionable in real time, so clients never encounter stale docs or outdated runbooks.

Competitors fail here. They just store static files.

🟢 3.1 Why Continuous Sync Matters

Systems evolve constantly: CI/CD pipelines, services, configs, scripts change daily.

Static docs = high risk of errors → clients can’t trust them.

InfoGrid automatically updates all knowledge in near real-time.
