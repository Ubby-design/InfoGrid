1.4 Structuring (critical step)

After parsing, you don’t store text.

You build structured knowledge objects.

InfoGrid internal model

Think like:

Entities
Service
Runbook
Pipeline
Environment
Owner
Resource
Policy

Example internal database
Service: payments
Owner: DevOps team
Runbooks:
   - deploy
   - rollback
   - restart
Pipelines:
   - build
   - deploy-prod
Infra:
   - db
   - redis


Now InfoGrid understands:

👉 relationships

This enables:

Later steps like:

“show all services owned by Team A”

“deploy this service”

“which runbooks affect prod?”

“what changed last week?”

Competitors can’t do this because they only have raw text.
